For years, a successful government operative specializing in infiltration and black ops, Severo Vidal worked for the CIA and several other agencies, many of which don't officially exist. After one of his associates was outed as a double-agent, Severo was burned due to guilt by association. Soon his former associates showed up, eager to 'retire' him. Tired of being on the run and eager to put his past life behind him and settle down, Severo faked his death and seamlessly insinuated himself into the elite of Bastion City. Behind the city's facade as beacon of civilization, Severo discovered seemingly-endless corruption, and after Sphere's fall from grace, he felt compelled to come out of retirement and put his old skills to work.

Later on, Carnaval sets up Division X with Peacekeeper's assistance. He quickly recruits Burgess. However, despite Carnaval's best efforts, he can't keep Friday out of Division X, and reluctantly allows her to join as well.
