Despite occasional clashes with heroes, the Baroness prefers to operate with extreme subtlety. In the shadows, behind the scenes, she layers schemes on schemes, building out a web of influence and information gathering that would rival any spy agency. In Bastion City, she manipulated the local government, local business, and various secret societies into working her will and concealing her activities. Those who attempted to oppose her found themselves buried in red tape, caught up in local politics or legal issues, or targeted by disreputable individuals. Few of these individuals even realized who their ultimate adversary was. With each move they made against corruption in the city, they found themselves further caught in the Baroness' web.

Even the heroes that struck out at her rarely realized that she was behind the evils they were investigating until it was too late. When they would get a lead on where to find her, the Baroness would already be gone. Those few situations where the heroes were able to encounter her directly, they found themselves walking into a trap. For each scheme they thwarted or interfered with, the Baroness had another ten. With so many defeats and only temporary victories, it seemed as though the Baroness' web could never be dismantled.
