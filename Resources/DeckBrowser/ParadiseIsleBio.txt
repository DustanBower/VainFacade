Constructed in 1889 on the gorgeous Paradise Isle, the Paradise Isle Grand Hotel has been associated with international luxury vacations ever since. Combining the lush tropical landscape and Caribbean beaches of the island with the endless amenities of the Grand Hotel results in a vacation experience that has long been envied the world over.

Not content to rest on its laurels, the hotel has been improved and expanded many times over the years by its various owners. Currently, the hotel is owned by international businessman Zavis Stanek, who quickly became so enamored with the property that he bought the entire island. Mr. Stanek has long encouraged dignitaries, C-Suite executives, and heads of state to travel to the Grand Hotel for working vacations, and travelers make bookings at the hotel in the hopes of rubbing elbows with the elite and gaining support in their careers or backers for the "next big thing."

Once a fixture on the island, Mr. Stanek has become increasingly reclusive recently, however, leading to endless rumors. While some suspect he's simply in poor health, others spin wild tales of strange happenings at the Grand Hotel, whispering of hidden rooms and secret passageways, and dark crimes that are somehow never officially reported.

Rather than hurt the Grand Hotel's bottom-line, however, the rumors that surround it have only strengthened its mystique, and those who seek a closer look at the hotel's mysteries eagerly line up to replace those who might be given pause. In particular, a well-to-do group of UFO-chasers meets frequently at the hotel to seek hidden evidence of a close encounter that supposedly took place in the vicinity.
