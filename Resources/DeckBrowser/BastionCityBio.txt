Initially settled to facilitate trade along the Bastion River, the town of Bastion always had a reputation for being a peaceful and safe place to live and work. As trade expanded, the town grew ever more quickly, being referred to as "Bastion City" well before it formally adopted the name. Even from its earliest days, Bastion City has always been known for having a relatively low crime rate, especially for violent crime.

The Bastion Police Department boasts some of the best police officers in the country, and the citizens of Bastion City can sleep safe at night knowing that the men and women in uniform are on the job. Additionally, a number of superheroes patrol the city, keeping the streets safe from evildoers.

For a time Sphere was officially known as the "Guardian of Bastion" by the Bastion City Council, but that honor was revoked after Sphere's careless destruction of the Wellington Complex resulted in the loss of several innocent lives.

But that is all in the past. Nowadays the city is safer than ever, although locals sometimes like winding up visitors with tales of dangerous secret societies and other urban legends.
