An invitation appears on your window, or bathroom mirror, in your diary, or even in your hand.

Responding to the invitation, you find yourself stepping through a fairy ring, a gap in a wall, through a mirror, or a door standing alone in a field. Sometimes what you find is an old parking lot simply packed with market stalls. Sometimes it's a castle courtyard lined with merchants. Sometimes it's an open field of circus tents. In the center, there is always a bar, a drink machine, a fountain, or a well. It's gone by the stroke of 1, with no evidence that the Bazaar had ever been there, besides purchases made and slightly hazy memories.

You can find potentially anything at the Midnight Bazaar, but at unpredictable costs. A shopkeeper might ask for the nail on your pinky, the color of your hair, your smile, your left upper canine tooth, your dreams, or even your heart. If you can find -- and understand -- it, you can buy someone else's past, or their future. You can buy luck, love, or fortune for yourself, or you can purchase doom for your enemies -- or, unwittingly, for yourself.

Bazaar etiquette requires that merchants deal with you honestly, but they have a habit of leaving out inconvenient details. 

Guests who harm vendors or other guests over the Long Hour risk falling out of favor with the Her Grace, losing all the protections that that provides.
