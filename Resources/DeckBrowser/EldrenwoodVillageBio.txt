In the mountains, near Eldrenwood Forest, sits a small town in the picturesque countryside. With few roads in and out, the village gets little traffic. Those who have passed through it have described the townspeople as helpful, but insular and wary of travelers. The townsfolk encourage visitors to leave before nightfall as the wildlife of the Eldrenwood forest is known to be aggressive at night, and many travelers have disappeared in the woods. Wild animal attacks have claimed people from the village as well, and its population has slowly dwindled over time. When asked for details, however, the villagers seem to have trouble remembering specifics.

Some who have stayed during the nights of the full moon report an unnatural stillness descending over the town, where all the normal wildlife sounds are replaced with rustles and distant howls. Others are found dead in the Eldrenwood. Others are never found at all.

These things just happen in the shadow of the forest.
